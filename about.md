# Work Experience
I have experience on multiple fields of software development, specially i'm focused on scripting and dockerization but My priority is to have the possibility to give good structure to the projects and keep them stable, key elements like good practices, modularization, unit testing, integration testing and keep them as updated as possible to have reliable projects.

## Data Base Administrator
Manage databases like Postgresql, Oracle, MongoDB, create tables, indexes, users, monitoring, help the organizations to reach a government of data (standards of data management)
## Data science
Perform analytics over data about organization, operations, billing, fraud detection, alerts, monitoring. Manage data pipelines.
## Web Development
Specially focus on Backend Development with Django Rest Framework, Fast API. Deployment web sites and usage Nginx, Cloudflare.
## Containerization
Most of my personal and work projects have Dockerfiles, Docker compose files with that perform deployment (production) on linux containers with Docker
## Server Administrador (Linux)
i love linux systems more control, more cheaper, versatile and Open Source
## Gaming programming Scripts and Server
Some game "servers" are in C++ and projects like https://www.trinitycore.org/, https://www.azerothcore.org/ i love execute, make changes and contribute to private servers that use these projects with custom modifications, fixes and more.

# Learning
I never stop learning current i'm learning about Python, Data science, Big data Pandas, numpy.

I love solve exercises from [exercism](https://exercism.org/profiles/Seeking) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) this help me to reinforce my knowledge about algorithms, structures, techniques and programming languages in general (Actually Python, C\# and Go).

# What does "Seeking Aura" mean?
Seeking Aura is my full nickname, this is made up of two parts "Seeking" and "Aura".

## Seeking part
The part of "Seeking" refers to Research, searching, investigation, or try to found something because I consider myself curious and hungry for knowledge, I keep in constant search of technologies, I investigate as much as I can about "how things work" I seek to have information about something as clear as possible because *The key to improving current solutions is to know how things work*.

## Aura part
"Aura" refers to [Wow Aura community](https://wowaura.com) this is a Spanish speaking community of a private Server about world of warcraft Lich King. This was the community where i contributed with bug reports, helped community members with their questions (about the game), I provided for several years customer service (Helping community members in the game), I also made contributions in the project that runs the server (made in c++) which is based on [Trinity Core community](https://trinitycore.org/) source code. 

Participating in [Wow Aura community](https://wowaura.com) gave me the motivation to learn much more about software development (formally in college in 2013), in fact the [Trinity Core](https://trinitycore.org/) project structure I learned by myself and once I had enough knowledge I could make several contributions to the [Wow Aura community](https://wowaura.com), this is [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ER61eCVxyY&pp=ygUTd293YXVyYSBzcXVpZCBldmVudA%3D%3D) of them.

## Preferred Nickname
Seeking is my preferred nickname for several things but when is not available i use SeekingAura.
