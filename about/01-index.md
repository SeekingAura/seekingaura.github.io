Hi!

I am a curious person who will research a topic if I do not understand it well. I am resilient, always striving to improve things, and a kind individual who loves to help and contribute to communities and teams. I am deeply invested in others' learning, ensuring they grasp not just the basics but also how things work and how they are connected-encouraging further research. This comprehensive understanding empowers each individual to contribute meaningfully and fosters their independent growth for the future.

In the Computer Science field, I have worked as a Teacher, Software Developer, Software Development Team Leader, Software Architect, DevOps, Site Reliability Engineer (SRE), and Database Administrator (DBA). I have updated and improved applications for various companies, achieving significant results in alignment with their growth projections in data and technology, as permitted by their investment in and trust in the IT team.

I have both formal and self-taught education (through courses, videos, and learning with partners) and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies in Software Development (Python, C#, C++, Rust, Go), System Administration (Ubuntu, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure), and Monitoring (Grafana, Sentry, ELK).

On the sidebar located at left of the website, you can navigate to other topics about me, such as work experience, education, and more!

You can find more detailed information of my work on Software development topics at my [Github Profile](https://github.com/SeekingAura) and about my work experience (Everything) at my [Linkedin Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlos-arturo-moreno-tabares-4b323022b/).


# Formation
at 2011 i study my studies about Basic of Electronics, Software development at 2011 how mechatronic technician, then at 2013 i started to study Bachelor about Computing and systems engineering (Computer science, informatica)
started to work in a formal way in IT (TI, Informatica) and Software Engineering  at 2018

Currently, I'm enhancing my expertise by solving algorithmic problems and keeping up with the latest changes in technology, especially in Python, Linux Shell, Docker, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, Go, Rust, and more! My focus is on Database Administration (DBA).

# Learning
I never stop learning current i'm learning about Python, Data science, Big data Pandas, numpy.

I love solve exercises from [exercism](https://exercism.org/profiles/Seeking) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) this help me to reinforce my knowledge about algorithms, structures, techniques and programming languages in general (Actually Python, C\# and Go).

# What does "Seeking Aura" mean?
Seeking Aura is my full nickname, this is made up of two parts "Seeking" and "Aura".

## Seeking part
The part of "Seeking" refers to Research, searching, investigation, or try to found something because I consider myself curious and hungry for knowledge, I keep in constant search of technologies, I investigate as much as I can about "how things work" I seek to have information about something as clear as possible because *The key to improving current solutions is to know how things work*.

## Aura part
"Aura" refers to [Wow Aura community](https://wowaura.com) this is a Spanish speaking community of a private Server about world of warcraft Lich King. This was the community where i contributed with bug reports, helped community members with their questions (about the game), I provided for several years customer service (Helping community members in the game), I also made contributions in the project that runs the server (made in c++) which is based on [Trinity Core community](https://trinitycore.org/) source code. 

Participating in [Wow Aura community](https://wowaura.com) gave me the motivation to learn much more about software development (formally in college in 2013), in fact the [Trinity Core](https://trinitycore.org/) project structure I learned by myself and once I had enough knowledge I could make several contributions to the [Wow Aura community](https://wowaura.com), this is [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ER61eCVxyY&pp=ygUTd293YXVyYSBzcXVpZCBldmVudA%3D%3D) of them.

## Preferred Nickname
Seeking is my preferred nickname for several things but when is not available i use SeekingAura.
