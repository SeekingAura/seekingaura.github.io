I have experience in multiple fields of software development, especially in scripting and dockerization. My priority is to structure projects effectively, ensure the best readability, and keep documentation up-to-date. Stability is key, along with good practices, modularization, unit testing, and integration testing. I strive to keep projects as updated as possible to maintain reliability and motivate the team to do the same.

On the sidebar located to the left of the website, you will find my specific experiences listed from the most recent to the least recent. Here is a summary of my experience by area:
* **Database Administrator**: Managing databases such as PostgreSQL, Oracle, MongoDB; creating tables, indexes, and users; monitoring; and assisting organizations in achieving data governance (standards of data management).
* **Data Science**: Performing analytics on data related to the organization, operations, billing, fraud detection, alerts, and monitoring. Managing data pipelines.
* **Web Development**: Specializing in Backend Development with Django Rest Framework and FastAPI. Deploying websites and utilizing Nginx, Cloudflare.
* **Containerization**: Most of my personal and work projects include Dockerfiles and Docker Compose files that facilitate deployment (production) on Linux containers with Docker.
* **Server Administrator (Linux)**: I prefer Linux systems for their control, cost-effectiveness, versatility, and open-source.
* **Game Programming, Scripts, and Server Management**: Some game servers are developed in C++ and projects like [TrinityCore](https://www.trinitycore.org/) and [AzerothCore](https://www.azerothcore.org/). I enjoy executing, making changes, and contributing to private servers that use these projects with custom modifications, fixes, and more.


My experience is quite varied; I am much more focused on areas related to DevOps, Docker, and Kubernetes, but my priority will be on the latest technologies, tailoring them to the company where I am employed.
