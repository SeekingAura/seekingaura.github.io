Before attending university, I engaged with academic projects on Associate's degree in [mechatronics](https://itspereira.edu.co/product/mecatronica/) at the [Instituto Técnico Superior de Pereira](https://itspereira.edu.co/).

These projects included a light-following robot, a line-following robot, and other programs created with **PIC-C** and **assembly language** through **Microchip technology**, specifically targeting the **PIC16F628A microcontroller**. Currently, I have not been able to locate photographs or the software that I developed there. However, it is crucial to note that these experiences marked the beginning of my entire career.

Additionally, at 2012 I worked as an Office Assistant (required social work at the Instituto Técnico Superior de Pereira for graduation). At that time, I was quite young for formal employment, being only **14-15 years old**.
