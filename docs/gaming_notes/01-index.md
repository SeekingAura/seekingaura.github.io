Notes, tips, and cheat sheets for the games I play!

Gaming is not just about "playing a game and nothing else" While enjoying and relaxing with a game, you can also solve puzzles and problems, dive into programming, scripting, data analysis, and so much more! Within every game, communities create a wealth of tools-like extended context, enhanced UI, data utilities, scripting resources, and beyond. Personally, I love exploring the possibilities of programming within games (such as creating macros and addons), as well as analyzing data like damage behavior, market trends, app usage, etc.

I spend my relaxing moments with gaming while thinking up new programming ideas and doing research. Here, I want to share relevant insights that could be useful to others interested in programming in games, along with general tips and tools that have been helpful to me.

* Do you enjoy learning how things work?
* Do you enjoy creating and exploring your own ideas?
* Do you enjoy doing research?

Here you will find notes that could enhance your gaming experience (specially if you enjoy learn stuff).
