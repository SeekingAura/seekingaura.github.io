The UI in WoW Retail have the capability to customize size, behavior and disposition about different things like:
* buffs and debuffs Frame
* Player, target and focus Frame
* Party and Raid frame
* Boss frame
* Chat frame
* Action Bars
* Status Bars
* Extra abilities

and much more, you can have multiple "profiles" and split into whatever you want like for different resolutions and different purposes (like For farming, dungeon, raid, etc)

# TL;DR
## Edit mode
In Edit Mode, you can **export** and **import** profiles allowing you to share it, transfer it to other accounts or copy from others. To import a configuration, go to the Layout list and click the **Import** option.

[![layout import](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/layout_import.jpg)](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/layout_import.jpg)

This will open a prompt where you can paste the import text. Below that, you can enter any name you'd like for the configuration. Keep in mind the intended resolution of each profile if it doesn't match the layout profile you're importing, some elements may be misplaced or require slight adjustments. Here, I'll share my configurations.


### Split 1900 1200
This mode have the action bars split in horizontal way and player frame are on top left of the monitor

# Edit Mode
This mode allow you to modify almost everything of your UI to enter on this mode you can write on chat
```txt
/editmode
```

Alternatively, right-click on the **General** tab of the chat window and select **Edit Mode**. 

Once you are in Edit Mode, most of the frames, action bars, and the minimap will display a square region that you can drag. If you click on any of these elements, you will access additional configuration options for that specific frame such as modifying its size or layout. Each frame has its own set of options.

**NOTE**: The things that you can edit here are the things "native" to the game, that means the UI elements related to addons usually are not included here.


## Layout
This works like the UI "profiles" here you can have multiple configurations of your UI, here you will have two default layouts (Preset) that you can't delete:
* Modern
* Classic

These ones every time that you set again will adapt to your current Resolution

### Create your own layout
Every time you create a layout, you can base it on an existing one. The first time you do this, you will use one of the presets. This guide uses the **Classic** preset (where the player frame is located at the top left). Many of the tips explained here also apply to the **Modern** preset (where the player frame is centered on the left side of the screen).

Once you select a preset make any modifications and then try to close from edit mode you will be prompted to save or discard changes if you try to save will ask to set a name in order to create a **New Layout** based on the current changes you have made. When you select any layout (preset or custom) and click on the **+ New Layout** option, a new layout profile will be created based on the currently active profile (like copy from current selected one). I recommend including the resolution in the layout name to help you remember which resolution was configured useful for future exports.

[![layout create](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/layout_create.jpg)](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/layout_create.jpg)

**NOTE**: If you create a layout for a specific resolution and later change your resolution, that layout may no longer be ideal as a new base. In that case, it's better to start with a preset again.


### Delete, Copy, Rename Layouts
You can manage your custom layouts by opening the layout list. When you hover your cursor over a layout name, you will see management icons appear:
- **Delete**: Prohibited icon
- **Copy or Rename**: Engine icon

[![layout profiles](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/layout_profiles.jpg)](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/layout_profiles.jpg)

## Edit elements
Once you have a base layout profile ready is the moment to customize according to your Monitor/Display and your style.

Every editable element in edit mode will display a light blue (almost transparent) region. When you hover your cursor over an element, its name will appear. If you click on the element, it will change color to yellow and display frame name in the center of element region also advanced options for the selected element will displayed, every element have their specific options.

All elements can be repositioned by clicking and dragging them, similar to a drag-and-drop system. To make alignment easier, it's recommended to enable the **Show Grid** option with a value of 100. **Snap Elements** be Enabled this allows elements to automatically snap into place when moved near another, helping them align closely and neatly. To see all possible elements (to enable or disable to see and be able to edit, required for the further steps) **Advanced Options** must be Enabled

[![grip and snap](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/grid_and_snap.jpg)](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/grid_and_snap.jpg)

**NOTE**: if your are new in the game just use any preset how is it focus to experiment a little bit the different things of the game like usage of your character, questing, dungeons, collections, etc.

### Frames
Refers a informative bar status of you, Allies, Enemies, Pet in different scenarios like Dungeons, Raid, Arena.

#### Chat Frame
This is the General Chat tray, where you can view messages from nearly all channels such as Say, Yell, Whispers, Party, Raid, Dungeon, and more. It also displays log messages like combat logs, miscellaneous updates, skill notifications, alerts, addon messages, and most other types of text. Chat tabs can be attached to this area.

Additionally, this frame contains special communication icons, including:
- **Social**: Manage friends, group finder (Who), raid, and Quick Join features.
- **Chat Channels (speaker icon)**: Manage in-game voice chats.
- **World Channels**: Access General, Trade, LocalDefense, and custom chat channels.

[![chat frame](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/chat_frame.jpg)](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/chat_frame.jpg)

In their advanced options, you can:
* **Width**: Adjust the width of the frame  
* **Height**: Adjust the height of the frame  

Alternatively, you can resize the frame manually using your mouse. In the bottom-right corner, you will see a triangle icon click and hold it, then drag to resize the frame until you are satisfied with its dimensions.

#### Player Frame
This frame by default is visible, there is no way to "hide" in edit mode (regular way) is always visible, this frame display your character name, current level and your current their status like health, power (Mana, energy, runic power, rage) and "special combat resources like runes, combo points, etc according to your class and talent specialization. To identify the frame and differentiate with Target and focus frame (that are similar), hover your cursor over it or click on it, and the frame name will be displayed.

[![player frame](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/player_frame.jpg)](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/player_frame.jpg)

In their advanced options, you can:
* **Frame Size**: Change the size of frame by percentage preserving their aspect ratio, the ideal size depends of your display in my case **130%** is ok
* **Cast Bar Underneath**: Enable or disable your cast bar will be below of player frame, **recommend value Disabled** if your player frame is in a corner (Classic preset)

#### Target Frame
This represents your current target, showing their status like health, power (mana, energy, rage, etc.), buffs, and debuffs. It only appears when you have a target whether ally, enemy, or neutral.

To view it in **Edit Mode** (even without a target), make sure the **Target and Focus** option is enabled in the **HUD Edit Mode** window. You will see a target example with yourself as a placeholder. To identify the frame and differentiate with Player and focus frame (that are similar), hover your cursor over it or click on it, and the frame name will be displayed.

[![target frame](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/target_frame.jpg)](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/target_frame.jpg)

In the advanced options, you can:
* **Buffs On Top**: Choose where to display the target's buffs and debuffs. With **Value Disabled** (default), they appear at the bottom ideal when the target is positioned at the top of the screen (like the classic preset). With **Value Enabled**, buffs and debuffs appear at the top typically used when the target is slightly below center (like the modern preset).
* **Frame Size**: Adjust the size of the target frame using a percentage value preserving the aspect ratio.

#### Focus Frame
This represents your focus, this is something like a target that you can setup with command ``/focus`` or right click to any target and then click on to option **Set Focus** (to remove without target execute **/focus**, for advanced usage check *here...to-do*) showing their status like health, power (mana, energy, rage, etc.), buffs, and debuffs. It only appears when you have a target whether ally, enemy, or neutral.

To view it in **Edit Mode** (even without a focus), make sure the **Target and Focus** option is enabled in the **HUD Edit Mode** window. You will see a focus example with yourself as a placeholder. To identify the frame and differentiate with Player and target frame (that are similar), hover your cursor over it or click on it, and the frame name will be displayed.

[![focus frame](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/focus_frame.jpg)](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/focus_frame.jpg)

In the advanced options, you can:
* **Use Larger Frame**: By default, Focus is smaller than the Target Frame. When **Value Enabled** is selected the focus frame will look more like to the Target Frame.
* **Buffs On Top**: Choose where to display the target's buffs and debuffs. With **Value Disabled** (default), they appear at the bottom ideal when the target is positioned at the top of the screen (like the classic preset). With **Value Enabled**, buffs and debuffs appear at the top typically used when the target is slightly below center (like the modern preset).
* **Frame Size**: Adjust the size of the target frame using a percentage value preserving the aspect ratio.

#### Party Frames
When you are in a Party (a team of 2-5 players, including yourself), you can see the status of each member such as health, power (mana, energy, rage, etc.), buffs, and debuffs. These can be displayed in different styles the "Default" representation and the Raid representation. Each style has its own advanced options. To view it in **Edit Mode** (even if you are not in Party), make sure the **Party Frames** option is enabled in the **HUD Edit Mode** window. A common advanced option is:
* **Use Raid-Style Party Frames**: Switch the party frame style between the Default style (**Value Disabled**) and the Raid style (**Value Enabled**), when this one is changed the available advanced options will change.

##### Default Style
This is similar to the Target Frame, displaying the character face of each party member. However, it waste space between members and only is can be used in vertical. Personally, I don't use this style.

[![party frame default](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/party_frame_default.jpg)](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/party_frame_default.jpg)

In the advanced options, you can:
* **Show Background**: The area where are the party frames show background (**Value Enabled**) or not (**Value Disabled**)
* **Frame Size**: Size in percentage of party Frames (all party members will have the same size and increase party frame area) preserving their aspect ratio

##### Raid Style
Similar to how Raid Frames work simple this style instead of character faces use thick bars that can show class colors and display larger health numbers. Each bar visually represents either the remaining or missing health, this style are affected by Raid interface config.

[![party frame raid](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/party_frame_raid.jpg)](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/party_frame_raid.jpg)

In the advanced options, you can:
* **Frame Width**: Adjust the width of the frame  
* **Frame Height**: Adjust the height of the frame  
* **Sort By**: Change how party members are sorted  
  * **Role**: Sorts by role in the order Tank, Healer, then Damage (DPS)  
  * **Group**: Displays members based on the order they joined or left the group. The default keybindings (F1-F5) will match the order shown.  
  * **Alphabetical**: Sorts by character name  
* **Use Horizontal Layout**: Changes the layout of the party frame to Horizontal (**Value Enabled**) or Vertical (**Value Disabled**). In my opinion, the best layout depends on how your action bars are set. If you use horizontal bars, the horizontal layout is better because the mouse distance between spells and party frames remains consistent for each member.  
* **Display Border**: Toggles the display a border on each member (**Value Enabled**) or hides it (**Value Disabled**)

#### Raid Frames
When you are in Raid (a team of 6-40 players), the raid is something like multiple groups (like party max 5 member) on the same team (max 8 groups) you can see the status of each member such as health, power (mana, energy, rage, etc.), buffs, and debuffs. Now the difference with party on this case is intended to be a lot of players this one uses smaller frames and optimal where show relevant info, like health and power bars in minimalistic mode. To view it in **Edit Mode** (even if you are not in Raid), make sure the **Raid Frames** option is enabled in the **HUD Edit Mode** window.

Raid Frames support two grouping techniques [Separated](#separated-mode) or [Combined](#combined-mode). These are the common advanced config:
* **Raid Size**: Show mock size (to get an idea when configuring raid frames in edit mode) for common raid sizes 10, 25, or 40 typically used in raids, battlegrounds, and world. This option does not allow have a different config per size is just a mock/example.
* **Frame Width**: Adjust the width of the frame  
* **Frame Height**: Adjust the height of the frame  
* **Groups**: Change how raid members groups are distributed horizontal or vertical and if are sorted (Combine Groups) or not (Separate Groups), this one change the advanced options.
  * **Separate Groups (Vertical)**: Show raid members by groups follow their respective Group number in vertical mode
  * **Separate Groups (Horizontal)**: Show raid members by groups follow their respective Group number in horizontal mode
  * **Combine Groups (Vertical)**: Show raid members all together (regardless incomplete group numbers) following the **Sort By** option in vertical mode
  * **Combine Groups (Horizontal)**: Show raid members all together (regardless incomplete group numbers) following the **Sort By** option in Horizontal mode

##### Separated Mode
Displays each group according their group number and display group number, preserving the order. Sorting options are not available in this mode. This option **is better if Group number matters** for mechanics, buffs groups limitation (know all the time). This one is **my preferred config** and i relocate the raid frames according to current member size trying to put more close where party frame was (close and aligned with action bars)

[![Raid frame Separated](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/raid_frame_separated.jpg)](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/raid_frame_separated.jpg)

**TIP**: Snap to grid the raid frames for easy symmetric relocation, you can made a simple edit at any moment according to your current needs.

Mock with raid size 10
[![Raid frame 10](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/raid_frame_10.jpg)](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/raid_frame_10.jpg)

Mock with raid size 25
![Raid frame 25](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/raid_frame_25.jpg)


The advanced options available only for this raid mode (in addition of common advanced options for raid frames):
* **Display Border**: Toggles the display a border on each member (**Value Enabled**) or hides it (**Value Disabled**)  

##### Combined Mode 
Shows all members as one large unified group on this case sort and grouping options are available. In this mode, **group numbers are not displayed** within the Raid Frame you can only check group numbers in the raid config for mechanics that use group numbers could be an issue and on your player frame you will now which group you are.

[![Raid frame Combined](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/raid_frame_combined.jpg)](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/raid_frame_combined.jpg)

The advanced options available only for combined mode (in addition of common advanced options for raid frames):
* **Sort By**: How groups are sort in raid regardless group numbers
* **Group by**:
  * **Role**: By role in the order Tank, Healer, then Damage (DPS)  
  * **Group**: Displays members based on the order managed in raid groups panel, the group numbers are not displayed if for some reason have groups with less 5 members they will displayed together (last player of one group with the first player of another group) BUT their **group number will not displayed** on raid frame
  * **Alphabetical**: Sorts by character name
* **Column Size**: Number of columns to have in raid frame disposition changing their size horizontally or vertically (according to their respective combined mode horizontal or vertical)

#### Pet Frame
Small Frame (smaller than the Target frame) displays your controlled unit, such as a **Pet** or **Guardian** (**Not all pets** or guardians are visualized in pet frame, only relevant or permanent). When you're in **certain vehicles**, your player frame will appear in Pet Frame position, and the **vehicle frame will take the Player Frame's position** sometimes with decorative borders depending on the type of vehicle. They aren't always literal vehicles like cars; sometimes the events simply **change your main action bar** for the event without mount literally vehicle sometimes could be npc control, structure, canon, etc.

[![pet frame](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/pet_frame.jpg)](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/pet_frame.jpg)

In the advanced options, you can:
* **Frame Size**: Change the size of frame by percentage preserving their aspect ratio

#### Boss Frames
