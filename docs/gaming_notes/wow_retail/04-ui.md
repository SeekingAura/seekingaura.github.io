The UI in WoW Retail have the capability to customize size, behavior and disposition about different things like:
* buffs and debuffs Frame
* Player, target and focus Frame
* Party and Raid frame
* Boss frame
* Chat frame
* Action Bars
* Status Bars
* Extra abilities

and much more, you can have multiple "profiles" and split into whatever you want like for different resolutions and different purposes (like For farming, dungeon, raid, etc)


# Edit Mode
This mode allow you to modify almost everything of your UI to enter on this mode you can write on chat
```txt
/editmode
```

Alternatively, right-click on the **General** tab of the chat window and select **Edit Mode**. 

Once you are in Edit Mode, most of the frames, action bars, and the minimap will display a square region that you can drag. If you click on any of these elements, you will access additional configuration options for that specific frame such as modifying its size or layout. Each frame has its own set of options.

**NOTE**: The things that you can edit here are the things "native" to the game, that means the UI elements related to addons usually are not included here.


## Layout
This works like the UI "profiles" here you can have multiple configurations of your UI, here you will have two default layouts (Preset) that you can't delete:
* Modern
* Classic

These ones every time that you set again will adapt to your current Resolution

### Create your own layout
Every time you create a layout, you can base it on an existing one. The first time you do this, you will use one of the presets. This guide uses the **Classic** preset (where the player frame is located at the top left). Many of the tips explained here also apply to the **Modern** preset (where the player frame is centered on the left side of the screen).

Once you select a preset make any modifications and then try to close from edit mode you will be prompted to save or discard changes if you try to save will ask to set a name in order to create a **New Layout** based on the current changes you have made. When you select any layout (preset or custom) and click on the **+ New Layout** option, a new layout profile will be created based on the currently active profile (like copy from current selected one). I recommend including the resolution in the layout name to help you remember which resolution was configured useful for future exports.

**NOTE**: If you create a layout for a specific resolution and later change your resolution, that layout may no longer be ideal as a new base. In that case, it's better to start with a preset again.


### Delete, Copy, Rename Layouts
You can manage your custom layouts by opening the layout list. When you hover your cursor over a layout name, you will see management icons appear:
- **Delete**: Prohibited icon
- **Copy or Rename**: Engine icon

## Edit elements
Once you have a base layout profile ready is the moment to customize according to your Monitor/Display and your style.

Every editable element in edit mode will display a light blue (almost transparent) region. When you hover your cursor over an element, its name will appear. If you click on the element, it will change color to yellow and display frame name in the center of element region also advanced options for the selected element will displayed, every element have their specific options.

All elements can be repositioned by clicking and dragging them, similar to a drag-and-drop system. To make alignment easier, it's recommended to enable the **Show Grid** option with a value of 100. **Snap Elements** be Enabled this allows elements to automatically snap into place when moved near another, helping them align closely and neatly. To see all possible elements (to enable or disable to see and be able to edit, required for the further steps) **Advanced Options** must be Enabled

**NOTE**: if your are new in the game just use any preset how is it focus to experiment a little bit the different things of the game like usage of your character, questing, dungeons, collections, etc.

### Frames
Refers a informative bar status of you, Allies, Enemies, Pet in different scenarios like Dungeons, Raid, Arena.

#### Player Frame
This frame by default is visible, there is no way to "hide" in edit mode (regular way) is always visible, this frame display your character name, current level and your health, power bar (Mana, energy, runic power, rage, runes, combo points) according to your class and talent specialization. To identify the frame and differentiate with Target and focus frame (that are similar), hover your cursor over it or click on it, and the frame name will be displayed.

In their advanced options, you can:
* **Frame Size**: Change the size of frame by % preserving their aspect ratio, the ideal size depends of your display in my case **130%** is ok
* **Cast Bar Underneath**: Enable or disable your cast bar will be below of player frame, **recommend value Disabled** if your player frame is in a corner (Classic preset)

#### Chat Frame
This is the General Chat tray, where you can view messages from nearly all channels such as Say, Yell, Whispers, Party, Raid, Dungeon, and more. It also displays log messages like combat logs, miscellaneous updates, skill notifications, alerts, addon messages, and most other types of text. Chat tabs can be attached to this area.

Additionally, this frame contains special communication icons, including:
- **Social**: Manage friends, group finder (Who), raid, and Quick Join features.
- **Chat Channels (speaker icon)**: Manage in-game voice chats.
- **World Channels**: Access General, Trade, LocalDefense, and custom chat channels.

[![chat frame](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/chat_frame.jpg)](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/chat_frame.jpg)

In their advanced options, you can:
* **Width**: Adjust the width of the frame  
* **Height**: Adjust the height of the frame  

Alternatively, you can resize the frame manually using your mouse. In the bottom-right corner, you will see a triangle icon click and hold it, then drag to resize the frame until you are satisfied with its dimensions.

#### Target Frame
This represents your current target, showing their health, power (mana, energy, rage, etc.), buffs, and debuffs. It only appears when you have a target whether ally, enemy, or neutral.

To view it in Edit Mode (even without an active target), make sure the **Target and Focus** option is enabled in the HUD Edit Mode window. You will see a target example using yourself as a placeholder. To identify the frame and differentiate with Player and focus frame (that are similar), hover your cursor over it or click on it, and the frame name will be displayed.


[![target frame](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/target_frame.jpg)](/assets/img/screenshots/docs/wow_retail/ui/target_frame.jpg)

In the advanced options, you can:
* **Buffs On Top**: Choose where to display the target's buffs and debuffs. With **Value Disabled** (default), they appear at the bottom ideal when the target is positioned at the top of the screen (like the classic preset). With **Value Enabled**, buffs and debuffs appear at the top typically used when the target is slightly below center (like the modern preset).
* **Frame Size**: Adjust the size of the target frame using a percentage value preserving the aspect ratio.
